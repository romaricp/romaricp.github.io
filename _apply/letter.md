Hello, 

My name is Romaric PAUL and I'm a french developer backend PHP. For the last six months I have been travelling around the world and decided to lay down my hat in New Zealand for a year or more. Passionate about web development since 18 years of age, and especially on the Symfony Framework, I would like to offer my expertise and work on large projects. I continuously keep my knowledge up to date.

I will arrive in Auckland in January first 2017 from Santiago in Chile. That will be a pleasure to meet you and speak about my experience and how can I bring my experience for your company. 

You can find in attachment my print resume and my online resume at this address : http://romaricp.github.io 
Do not hesitate to contact me if you want more informations. 

Have a nice day, 
Regards

Romaric PAUL
