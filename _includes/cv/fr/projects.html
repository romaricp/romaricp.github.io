            J'adore les nouveaux défis et surtout les nouvelles idées. Laissez-moi vous présenter mes deux dernières :

                    I built this new web service with three friends to allow people to share their adventures while travelling. As the backend developer, I configured the web servers and coded all APIs ( <a href="http://travelgram.co/api/doc">Doc is available here</a> ). We worked as a team with our GIT repository, we planned our meetings weekly to ensure that no major issue would interrupt the development process. The entire application was based on Instagram's API. I optimised a class to use this API which is now <a href="https://github.com/romaricp/api-instagram-with-php" target="_blank">open-source</a>.

                    I created this company with a friend six years ago. In the beginning we started as an association which was an immediate success. We felt that the potential of this product in France was high. So we decided to launch a business to sell our products : Freeline Skates! Now we have them manufactured in China and the business is growing year after year. I coded this website with the Magento CMS and optimised it as much as possible, as I am aware of Magento's performance issues.
