	    	Currently I'm traveling around the world since 6 months ago and I decided to let my bags in New Zealand for a minimum of one year. Passionate about web development since I was 18 years old, I like to be a force for proposals and work on large projects. I love learning daily new development techniques and especially <strong>I am passionate about the Symfony Framework ! </strong>
