Hello, 

My name is Romaric PAUL and I'm a french developer backend PHP. Currently I'm traveling around the world since 6 months and I decided to lay down my hat in New Zealand for a minimum of one year. Passionate about web development since I'm 18 years old, I like to be a source of proposals and work on large projects. Daily, I like learning new development technical and I am especially passionate about the Symfony Framework !

I will arrive in Auckland in January first from Santiago in Chile. That will be a pleasure to meet you to speak about my experience and how can I bring my experience for your company. 

You can find in attachment my print resume and my online resume at this address : http://romaricp.github.io 
Do not hesitate to contact me if you want more informations. 

Have a nice day, 
Regards

Romaric PAUL
